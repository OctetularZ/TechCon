            <h1>Steve Jobs</h1>
            <p>Steve Jobs is an American inventor, designer, and entrepreneur who is the cofounder, chief executive,
              and chairman of Apple Inc. Born in 1955 to two University of Wisconsin graduate students who gave him up
              for adoption, Jobs was smart but directionless, dropping out of college and experimenting with different
              pursuits before cofounding Apple with Steve Wozniak in 1976. Jobs left the company in 1985, launching
              Pixar Animation Studios, then returned to Apple more than a decade later. The tech giantâ€™s revolutionary
              products, which include the iPhone, iPad, and iPod, have dictated the evolution of modern technology.

            <h1>Bill Gates</h1>
            <p>Entrepreneur and businessman Bill Gates and his business partner Paul Allen founded and built the world's
              largest software business, Microsoft, through technological innovation, keen business strategy and
              aggressive business tactics. In the process, Gates became one of the richest men in the world. In February
              2014, Gates announced that he was stepping down as Microsoft's chairman to focus on charitable work at his
              foundation, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.</p>

              University. Zuckerberg left college after his sophomore year to concentrate on the site, the user base of
              which has grown to more than two billion people, making Zuckerberg a billionaire many times over. The
              birth of Facebook was portrayed in the 2010 film The Social Network. Facebook is one of the most used
