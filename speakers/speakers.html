            <h1>Steve Jobs</h1>
            <p>Steve Jobs is an American inventor, designer, and entrepreneur who is the cofounder, chief executive,
              and chairman of Apple Inc. Born in 1955 to two University of Wisconsin graduate students who gave him up
              for adoption, Jobs was smart but directionless, dropping out of college and experimenting with different
              pursuits before cofounding Apple with Steve Wozniak in 1976. Jobs left the company in 1985, launching
              Pixar Animation Studios, then returned to Apple more than a decade later. The tech giantâ€™s revolutionary
              products, which include the iPhone, iPad, and iPod, have dictated the evolution of modern technology.
